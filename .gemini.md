# Gemini Project Configuration

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack monorepo managed with Yarn Workspaces. It consists of a Node.js backend (`api`) and a React frontend (`app`). The project is built following the principles of Clean Architecture.

## Tech Stack

- **Monorepo:** Yarn Workspaces
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Tooling:** Docker, ESLint

## Key Commands

- **Install all dependencies:** `yarn install` (must be run from the project root).
- **Run backend (dev mode):** `yarn workspace api dev`
- **Run frontend (dev mode):** `yarn workspace app dev`
- **Add dependency to a workspace:** `yarn workspace <workspace_name> add <package_name>`
- **Add dev dependency to a workspace:** `yarn workspace <workspace_name> add <package_name> -D`
- **Add dependency to the root:** `yarn add <package_name> -W -D`

## Architecture & Conventions

- **Clean Architecture:** Strictly adhere to the separation of concerns. Do not mix business logic with UI or database code.
- **Backend Structure:** The backend is divided into `domain`, `application`, `services`, and `models`. New features should follow this established pattern.
- **Frontend Structure:** The frontend is organized by features (e.g., `src/features/auth`). New UI components should be placed in `src/components` and pages in `src/pages`.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for all styling in the frontend. Avoid plain CSS or other styling libraries.
- **Language:** Respond in Spanish.
